DOCUMENT 2: TECH STACK (AMD-Compatible Architecture)

This stack is optimized for Advanced Micro Devices CPUs & GPUs.

1. Infrastructure Philosophy

Designed to:

Run efficiently on AMD EPYC servers

Support AMD Radeon GPUs

Leverage ROCm for AI acceleration

Be cloud-agnostic

Scale horizontally

2. Backend Stack
Language

Python (primary)

Rust (for execution engine)

TypeScript (API layer)

Framework

FastAPI (high-performance API)

Node.js (optional microservices)

3. Code Execution Engine
Isolation

Docker

Firecracker microVM (recommended)

Sandbox Controls

CPU time limit

Memory cap

No network access

File write restrictions

Optimized for AMD multi-core scaling.

4. AI Reasoning Engine
Framework

PyTorch (ROCm-supported)

HuggingFace Transformers

AMD GPU Acceleration

ROCm stack

Radeon Instinct / Radeon Pro GPUs

EPYC CPU fallback support

5. Blockchain Layer
Smart Contracts

Solidity

ERC-721 standard

Networks

Polygon (low gas)

Base

Ethereum L2

NFT minting microservice verifies achievement engine before mint.

6. Database Stack
Primary DB

PostgreSQL

Cache

Redis (leaderboards, streaks)

Object Storage

S3-compatible storage (MinIO for self-hosted)

7. Real-Time Infrastructure

WebSockets (FastAPI)

Redis Pub/Sub

Kafka (if scaling needed)

8. Frontend Stack

Next.js (React)

TailwindCSS

Web3 wallet integration

Recharts (analytics)

9. DevOps & Deployment
Containerization

Docker

Orchestration

Kubernetes

CI/CD

GitHub Actions

10. AMD-Specific Optimization Strategy
Why AMD?

EPYC = high core count → parallel evaluation scaling

ROCm = open GPU compute

Cost-efficient scaling

AI Training Strategy

Train models on AMD GPUs

Use quantized inference models

Support CPU inference fallback

11. Security Stack

JWT auth

OAuth (Google/GitHub login)

Smart contract audits

Static code analysis

Rate limiting

Anti-cheat ML anomaly detection

12. Scaling Strategy
Horizontal Scaling

Evaluator pods:

Stateless

Autoscaled

Rush Engine:

In-memory optimized

AI Engine:

GPU-backed nodes

13. Recommended Deployment Model (Hackathon → Production)
Stage 1 (Hackathon)

Single AMD-based VM

Docker Compose

Polygon testnet

Stage 2 (Early Startup)

AMD EPYC cloud instances

Kubernetes cluster

Redis cluster

GPU inference node
