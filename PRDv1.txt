KamiCode
AI-Native Competitive Programming with Verifiable On-Chain Credentials

1. Product Overview

KamiCode is an AI-native competitive programming platform that converts verified coding performance into on-chain NFTs as portable proof of skill.

It combines:

Depth-based algorithmic competition (Daily Mode)

Speed-based streak solving (Rush Mode)

AI-based code quality analysis

Season-based rating systems

NFT-based verifiable credentials

2. Problem Statement

Existing platforms like:

LeetCode

Codeforces

HackerRank

Have limitations:

Achievements are centralized

No verifiable proof of “first solver”

No immutable ranking history

Badges are non-transferable

No on-chain competitive context

Developers cannot publicly prove competitive performance with timestamped validation.

3. Vision

Transform coding performance into:

A decentralized reputation layer

A competitive esport system

A verifiable hiring signal

A seasonal skill graph
